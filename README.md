# AnalyticsPortfolio
Portfolio to showcase my analytics work.

The Nexant2 file is an ongoing project to use information gathered from the California ISO along with weather data 
to create a short term electricity price forecasting model. The current work in the notebook is all the steps we took to gather
the information. It required canvassing all the nodes within the specific region, finding the weather stations near these nodes,
and then aggregating weather data on these nodes to be able to combine with our historical information from the California ISO.

Using this information we will be building a forecasting model to predict prices tomorrow or even a week from now. More to come!
